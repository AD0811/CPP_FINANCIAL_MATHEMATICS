# CPP_FINANCIAL_MATHEMATICS

This repository contains a collection of projects and exercises that I have completed while learning C++ from "C++ for Financial Mathematics" by "John Armstrong". The code here showcases various concepts and techniques in C++ programming, ranging from basic syntax to more advanced topics.

# Contents
**Basics**: Simple programs covering basic syntax, data types, and control structures.

**Functions**: Examples of function declarations, definitions, and overloading.

**Classes and Objects**: Demonstrations of object-oriented programming, including class definitions, inheritance, and polymorphism.

**STL (Standard Template Library)**: Sample code utilizing STL containers and algorithms.

**File I/O**: Programs for reading from and writing to files.

**Pricing Models**: Implementations of various pricing models, demonstrating concepts such as financial mathematics and algorithmic pricing.

**Advanced Topics**: More complex projects involving advanced C++ features such as templates, exception handling, and smart pointers.

# Purpose
The primary purpose of this repository is to serve as a personal learning log and a resource for others who are learning C++. It provides practical examples of how to implement various C++ features and can be a helpful reference for beginners. Additionally, this repository explores financial applications, showcasing how C++ can be used in developing pricing models and other financial algorithms.

Feel free to explore, use, and modify the code. Feedback and contributions are welcome!
